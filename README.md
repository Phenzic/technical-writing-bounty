# Technical Writing Spotlight Bounty

We're on the lookout for high quality articles showcasing your work and your exploration of the Fuel tech stack. This bounty is open to all current Fuel Developer Champions. If you're not a Developer Champion yet, you can start your journey [here](https://github.com/fuel-champions/start-here).

Accepted and published articles will earn you the admiration of your peers and a $500 USDC reward. Your work will be featured on our blog and potentially other distribution formats, and with the support of our marketing and social media teams, your article will gain significant visibility.

Please read the following guidelines carefully before submitting your article idea. All ideas should first be submitted as a new Issue in this repository.

## What We're Looking For

We're on the lookout for in-depth technical articles that showcase the unique capabilities of the Fuel ecosystem. We want to see how developers are leveraging Fuel's advanced architecture, the FuelVM, and our comprehensive developer tooling ecosystem, including Sway, to create real-world applications. Your submissions should highlight how these tools enable unprecedented execution speed and an enhanced development experience, setting them apart in the world of web3.

Criteria for successful submissions:

- **Originality:** We seek content that hasn't been published elsewhere, showcasing innovative applications and use cases specific to the Fuel ecosystem. Your article should reflect a fresh perspective and original ideas that demonstrate the unique advantages of using Fuel's technology.
- **Quality:** Submissions must be coherent, well-structured, and in line with our editorial standards. While we provide editorial assistance, we expect each article to be carefully proofread and require minimal editing.
- **Technical Depth and Relevance:** Articles should not only be informative and practical but also highlight the distinctive features of the Fuel ecosystem. Emphasize how the FuelVM and tools like Sway contribute to building applications that are unfeasible on other platforms, with a focus on execution speed and developer experience. The code and technical content should be clearly explained, well-documented, and serve as a valuable learning resource for our readers.

### Does my post have to be about Fuel?

Yes, your articles should be centered around Fuel, highlighting its features, capabilities, or integrations with other web3 technologies.

### What we're not looking for

- Basic tutorials on Fuel usage.
- General opinion pieces.
- Introductions to unrelated third-party frameworks or programming languages.
- Non-technical content.
- Previously published articles or topics already covered on our blog.

## Bounty Details

- **Payment:** $500 USDC per accepted and published post.
