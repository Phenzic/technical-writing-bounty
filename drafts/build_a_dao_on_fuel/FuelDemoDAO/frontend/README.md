## Getting Started

The currently implemented frontend is a minimal representation of the smart contract functionalities as the main tutorial is focused on getting you started with writing sway smart contracts.

The idea is to encourage you to run your sway contract and create your contract instance, following through the main tutorial, and encourage you to add more contract calls, and functionalities to the currently existing frontend code. You might also want to showcase your design skills while you're at it.

### Cloning the frontend
Run the command to clone the frontend repo into your workspace.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Phenzic/fuel_frontend_starter
```


### Package Installation
Change into the frontend directory and run the command `npm install` to install all the packages.

### Creating your contract Instance
Follow through the tutorial [here](https://github.com/Phenzic/blabalbal) on how to write, compile, and deploy your sway contract, you will also generate an instance of your sway smart contract on your frontend application to use on your react app.

***Note: Following the main tutorial, you will be required to put in your deployed contract address (`CONTRACT_ID`) to connect with your smart contract on-chain***


### Starting your Frontend
Run the command to start up the Dao frontend
```bash
npm start
```

### Making Contributions
After cloning the applications and making your preferred design changes and updates.
You can create another branch and open a new PR, including a clear topic and description of the designs and added functionalities (contract calls) you have added.
